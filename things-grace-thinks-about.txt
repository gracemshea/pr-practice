1. What would it feel like to sleep like a dolphin with half your brain sleeping at a time?
2. I feel like I've been in the PNW so long that my eyeballs now reject sunshine. But I love sunshine!
3. I wish we could have this class in the park in the grass with dogs around and old folks with visors stretching.
4. Yellow. I just like to think about the color yellow.
